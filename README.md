# Algorithms

## Assignment 1
- Purpose: To implement backtracking algorithms and search trees.
- Goal 1: The first task of the assignment is to create a backtracking algorithm that finds one legal filling of
the squares of a given crossword puzzle (if a legal filling exists), as specified in detail below.
- Goal 2: The second task is to use de la Briandais trees to improve the search efficiency in Task 1 and
hence be able to produce all possible legal fillings of a given crossword puzzle.

## Assignment 2
- Purpose: To implement a hybrid Symbol Table that provides hash table access, indexed integer access,
and sequential access (using an iterator).
- Goal 1: To implement a linear probing hash table.
- Goal 2: To implement an iterator.

## Assignment 3
- Purpose: The purpose of this assignment is for you to fully understand the LZW compression algorithm,
its performance and its implementation. We will improve the performance of the textbook's LZW
implementation when the input files are large.
- Goal 1: Read the input file as a stream of bytes (i.e., byte by byte) instead of all at once.
- Goal 2: Avoid the Theta(n) overhead of using String.substring().
- Goal 2: Allow the codebook size to increase beyond the 4096 entries in the textbook's implementation
using adaptive codeword width.
- Goal 3: Allow LZW to learn new patterns after the codebook size is reached by giving the user the option
to reset the codebook.

## Assignment 4
- Purpose: The purpose of this programming assignment is to implement a primitive secure
communications system utilizing the RSA cryptosystem and two primitive symmetric ciphers â€“ a
substitution cipher and an additive cipher.

## Assignment 5
- Purpose: The purpose of this assignment is to make you practice implementing some simple graph
algorithms and to see how they can be used in a somewhat practical way.
